I'm a Phd student from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.njust.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](https://www.njust.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, machine learning and human pose estimation.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhang](http://202.119.85.163/open/TutorInfo.aspx?dsbh=fD241wcSo3T3UEXLQU3h4w==&yxsh=4iVdgPyuKTE=&zydm=fY2NaWnaNpk=) of PCALab.
